# Development of a Sinhala Natural Language Processing Toolkit

In this project, I undertook the task of creating a comprehensive Sinhala Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkit from scratch, comprising essential components such as Sinhala stopwords, Sinhala stemming, and a Sinhala word2vec model. This work represents a substantial contribution to the NLP community, specifically for the Sinhala language, and demonstrates my commitment to advancing the field of NLP for underrepresented languages.

## Sinhala Stopwords:
I meticulously curated and compiled a list of Sinhala stopwords, tailored to the unique linguistic characteristics of the Sinhala language. This list includes commonly occurring words that typically do not carry significant semantic meaning, allowing for more accurate and meaningful text analysis.

## Sinhala Stemming:
Developing an effective Sinhala stemming algorithm was a critical aspect of this project. I designed and implemented a Sinhala-specific stemming algorithm to reduce words to their base or root form, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval and analysis in the Sinhala language.

## Sinhala Word2Vec Model:
To enable advanced NLP tasks, such as word embedding and semantic similarity analysis, I trained a Sinhala Word2Vec model. This model captures the semantic relationships between words in the Sinhala language and allows for the transformation of words into high-dimensional vectors that can be used for various NLP applications.

Throughout the project, I leveraged Python and popular libraries such as NLTK, Gensim, and TensorFlow to build and train these NLP components. Additionally, I conducted extensive research on the Sinhala language's linguistic nuances and challenges to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the developed tools.

This project aims to empower researchers, developers, and organizations working with the Sinhala language, facilitating more sophisticated and insightful NLP applications in fields such as information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and text classification. The Sinhala NLP toolkit I created represents a valuable resource for the Sinhala-speaking community and an embodiment of my dedication to advancing NLP for languages with limited NLP resources.
